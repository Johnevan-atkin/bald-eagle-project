            <h2>Habitat Notes</h2>
            <h3>Where on the earth does your animal live?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle lives in the Sonoran Desert near rivers and lakes where there’s water. This is a special place with cactuses and mountains!</p>
            <h3>Where does my animal sleep?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle sleeps in nests made of sticks up high in tall trees or on cliffs. They build these nests to stay safe from danger.</p>
            <h3>Who does my animal live with?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle lives with their mates, who are their special eagle friends. Sometimes they also live with their baby chicks in the nest!</p>
            <h3>What is the life span of my animal?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle can live for around 30 years if it stays healthy. That’s a really long time for a bird in the Sonoran Desert!</p>

            <h3>How do they get their food?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle gets its food by hunting with its sharp beaks and strong claws. It flies high and swoops down to grab its dinner!</p>
            <h3>How often do they eat?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle eats every day to stay strong and healthy. It needs lots of food to fly and take care of its babies!</p>

            <h2>Predators Notes</h2>
            <h3>What animals hunt my animal for prey?</h3>
            <p>No animals hunt my bald eagle for prey because it’s so big and strong. Even in the Sonoran Desert, it’s the boss of the sky!</p>
            <h3>How does my animal avoid the predators?</h3>
            <p>My bald eagle doesn’t have to avoid predators because nothing tries to catch it. It stays safe by flying high where no one can reach it!</p>
